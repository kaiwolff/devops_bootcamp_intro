# Notes - DevOps Intro

## Why DevOps?

- Aim of DevOps is to bridge the gap that used to exist between Development and Operations Team. 

- Through smaller releases and continuous deployment, the effect of bugs is lessened as they are not having to be fixed at the end of a large, monolithic software release but rather can be traced directly back to a smaller addition (which can, if necessary, be rolled back with decreased loss).
- By combining teams, there is also a decrease in the  dependency on a separate team. 
- Important to remember that DevOps is about a culture, not a singular job role.

## Pillars of DevOps

- Ease of Use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost Effectiveness

## Pre-DevOps
### Monolithic Architecture

- Predecessor of Agile methodology. 
- Software was designed with all features interdependent, rather than a modular approach. 
- This has some advantages, but struggles to adjust to change, and with scalability. DevOps addresses a lot of the weaknesses of this methodology.
- These weaknesses were becoming particularly apparent in current software development, where it is common for an app's userbase to change size in shorter amounts of time.

### Waterfall

This approach was widely used before DevOps practices became widespread. In this a project is planned in a series of steps, with each step starting only after the previous one is completed. This meant long lead times, and could lead to issues when bugs were discovered later in the process, as the issue may have it's root at a significantly earlier stage.

### Transition to Agile/Scrum

Agile methodologies emphasise small steps, and flexibility. Using scrum as an example.
